**Introduction**
The project focuses on both accuracy and explainability, and uses a wide range of algorithms and techniques that harmonize traditional machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning paradigms.
The data and the task refer to the Kaggle Challenge regerding the classification of the reviews : source [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/goodreads-books-reviews-290312]

**EDA & Data Mining**

**ML:** 
- Rocchio algorithm:
a classic technique based on vector space models. The Rocchio algorithm is particularly well-suited for working with text data because it considers the frequency of terms within a document when classifying documents.
- Combination of Rocchio with K-Means:
adding another layer of sophistication to the model. 

**DL:** 

Transformer model with transfer learning:
- GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) 
- DistilBERT
