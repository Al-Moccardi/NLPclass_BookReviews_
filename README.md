## NLP classification using Data Mining , Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning 

**Introduction**
The project focuses on both accuracy and explainability, and uses a wide range of algorithms and techniques that harmonize traditional machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning paradigms.

First, we tackle the field of text classification using the Rocchio algorithm, a classic technique based on vector space models. The Rocchio algorithm is particularly well-suited for working with text data because it considers the frequency of terms within a document when classifying documents.

Based on the foundation of the Rocchio algorithm, it incorporates K-means clustering. Combining Rocchio with K-Means adds another layer of sophistication to the model. This hybrid approach allows you to group similar reviews using K-means and classify review scores using Rocchio's methodology. This combination aims to improve the granularity and accuracy of classification tasks.

After experimenting with traditional machine learning, we embarked on the deep sea of ​​learning. Our main focus is not only on achieving a high level of predictive accuracy, but also on the fact that the model can be interpreted and explained. We use the Transformer model, known for its excellent ability to process continuous data such as text, due to its attention mechanism. The search for explainable AI begins with transfer learning, which uses GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) for feature extraction. GloVe is pre-trained on an extensive corpus to capture semantic relationships between words. This provides a robust set of functions that encapsulate the underlying semantics of evaluation.

We go a step further and optimize the model using DistilBERT, a lighter and faster version of his original BERT model. Fine-tuning with DistilBERT allows the model to adapt to specific nuances and patterns in the dataset, improving accuracy. In short, the project is an orchestration of techniques ranging from Rocchio algorithms to K-Means clustering to deep learning with Transformers. By combining these techniques and focusing on explainable AI through transfer learning and fine-tuning, we aim to create models that are not only accurate but also insightful and interpretable.
